# Segmentation of an unknown spacecraft for In-space Inspection

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a real-time segmentation algorithm for in-space inspection of spacecraft using deep learning techniques. The focus is to build a general-purpose instance segmentation model that can accurately detect and mask spacecraft components. The model will be trained on synthetic and real datasets using the YOLOv8 nano model, optimized to run on resource-constrained hardware. This algorithm is expected to enhance NASAâ€™s capability for autonomous inspections, improving spacecraft navigation, pose estimation, and structural analysis under various visual distortions in space imagery.

## Setup

1. Create a Python `venv` environment

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

2. Activate the environment
   -On Windows:
   
        ```sh
        .\.venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -On macOS/Linux:
   
        ```sh
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install requirements
